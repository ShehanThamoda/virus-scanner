File Virus Scanner Every Minute
Overview
The File Virus Scanner Every Minute project is a robust security solution designed to continuously monitor and safeguard your system against potential threats. By implementing a cron job that executes every minute, the system ensures real-time scanning of files, providing rapid detection and response to any malicious activity.

Key Features
Automated Scanning: The project employs a cron job to automatically trigger the virus scanner at regular intervals (every minute). This automation ensures a proactive approach to security, minimizing the risk of undetected threats.

Multi-Layered Detection: The virus scanner utilizes a multi-layered approach to detect and identify potential viruses, malware, and other malicious entities within files. This includes signature-based scanning, heuristic analysis, and behavior-based detection techniques.

Notification System: In the event of a detected threat, the system is equipped with a notification mechanism to alert administrators or designated personnel promptly. Timely notifications enable swift response and mitigation of security risks.

Quarantine Functionality: When a file is identified as malicious, the system has the capability to quarantine the affected file, preventing it from causing further harm while allowing for further analysis or removal.

Configurable Settings: The project provides configurable settings, allowing users to customize scan parameters, define file types to be included or excluded from scans, and adjust sensitivity levels based on specific security requirements.
